##Neural Netwok for CAT
Objective: The primary goal of the project seems to be developing a model that predicts the weights of questions in a CAT. This could be crucial for adaptive testing systems, where the difficulty of subsequent questions is adjusted based on the test-taker's performance.

Technology Stack:

Deep Learning: The use of a neural network implies a deep learning approach, suggesting a model capable of learning intricate patterns and representations from the given data.
Python: The project is developed using Python, a popular programming language for machine learning and deep learning tasks.
Google Colaboratory: The use of Google Colab indicates that the project leverages cloud-based Jupyter notebooks, offering free access to GPU resources for training deep learning models.
Datasets:

Train and Test Datasets: The project likely involves a training dataset for training the neural network and a separate test dataset for evaluating its performance.
Question Weights: The datasets probably include information about the weights assigned to each question in the CAT.
Methodology:

Neural Network Architecture: The specific neural network architecture (e.g., feedforward, recurrent, or convolutional neural network) would be defined to capture the patterns in the data.
Training Process: The neural network is trained on the training dataset to learn the relationships between the input features (possibly question characteristics) and the target output (question weights).
Usage:

The trained model can be utilized to predict question weights for new sets of questions in a CAT.
